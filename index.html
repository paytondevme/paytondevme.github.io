        <h1>Hi, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/paytondev">paytondev</a>ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <h2>I'm a bit of a developer myself</h2>
        <p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/paytondev">paytondev</a>, a versatile developer with (sometimes) good ideas</p>
        <p>I really enjoy mobile/desktop development, but I also enjoy web development because it's easy to prototype quickly</p>
        <p>Here are some of the mobile/desktop development frameworks I know:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>SwiftUI (Swift)</li>
           <li>Jetpack Compose (Kotlin)</li>
           <li>Flutter (Dart)</li>
           <li>Unity (C#)</li>
           <li>Windows Forms/Fluent UI (C#)</li> 
           <li>React Native (JS)</li>
           <li>Electron (JS)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And some of the web development framworks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>plain HTML (HTML)</li>
            <li>Vue.js (JS)</li>
            <li>React.js (JS)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I have several projects (both in development and not)</p>
        <h3>Bookmark - Save your pages</h3>
        <p>Bookmark - Save your pages is a convienent app made to help you keep track of your books<br>It has both an iOS client and a watchOS client so you can track your pages on the go. It was built entirely with Swift and SwiftUI and is currently on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bookmark-save-your-pages/id1617347854">app store.</a></p>
        <h3>SafeSign</h3>
        <p>SafeSign is an electron-based app that is perfect for those who need to know when and if someone is signing into their computer. Whenever someone signs into your computer, SafeSign will send you an email telling you what computer was signed into, and what day and time.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(255, 166, 0);">SafeSign is currently on hold due to issues with SendGrid, my email provider. I will inform you on this website once it comes back.</p>
