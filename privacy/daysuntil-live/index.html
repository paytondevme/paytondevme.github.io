By starting a Live Activity using DaysUntil Live, you temporarily send your countdown (including: name, target date, completion text) **to a server that I manage**.<br/>I personally lack the expertise to examine your countdowns, as they are only stored in memory. But, as a precaution: **you should not include ANY personal information in your countdowns if you intend to use DaysUntil Live Activities**.<br/>Again, I lack the expertise to look at your countdowns, and I have to need or motivation to anyways, but you should always take proper security precautions.
