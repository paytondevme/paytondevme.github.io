    <h3>Hello,</h3>
    <p>We detected a sign-in on your device. The sign-in occured on {{date}}. If this was you, you can (obviously) safely disregard this message. You can also disable sign-in notification in the SafeSign app, or via the menu icon. Your computer was not in SafeSign locked mode, so we do not have any images from your device.</p>
